# Code of Conduct

Please be professional and courteous. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer, but nevertheless, the project maintainers have the final say even when you disagree. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

## Purpose

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in the hapi project to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

A primary goal of the hapi project is to be inclusive to the largest number of developers, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a safe and professional environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

## Enforcement

This Code of Conduct is maintained and enforced by the hapi core contributors group.

## Scope

This policy applies for any interaction with other hapi community members.

Whether on GitHub, Twitter, IRC, Slack, or any other venue, your actions matter. We expect all members of the hapi community, including both users and contributors, to behave respectfully to others regardless of venue and regardless whether the communication is about the hapi project or not.

Expressing opinions which may offend others in public or in private may trigger a policy violation review. Our goal is to provide a safe and welcoming environment and when a conflict arises between one person's freedom of expression and another's sense of safety, we will take the necessary actions to ensure the project remains a welcoming and safe environment for all.

A person's past contribution to the hapi project will not be considered when evaluating their behavior. No expertise or contribution excuse offensive behavior.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an productive and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public. Please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

When possible, a warning should be given before taking other actions. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If you disagree, first take steps to suspend and remove the offending materials or actions, then raise your objections in a polite and appropriate manner. If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should reach out via the contacts below with a description of your grievance.

If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could have communicated better. Remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow community members comfortable, safe, and welcomed.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
