# Support Resources

### Visit the [hapi.dev](https://hapi.dev) Developer Portal for tutorials, documentation, and support.

The portal contains all the resources needed to successfully build hapi-based applications. The content is all free and published under the same BSD license. Feel free to copy and share.

## Community Support

Free support is always available on GitHub. Just open an issue with your question and a community member will try to help. For faster response, join the hapi [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/hapihour/shared_invite/zt-g5ortpsk-ErlnRA2rUcPIWES21oXBOg) – it’s where many community members hang out and help each other.
Like all open source projects, free support is constrained by the availability of volunteer resources.
